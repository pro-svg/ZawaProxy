# ZawaProxy Setup

Welcome to ZawaProxy, a script for setting up 1.1.1.1 encrypted DNS and creating a hotspot on your jailbroken iPhone.

## Setup

1. Navigate to your preferred directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/directory
Replace "/path/to/your/directory" with the actual path where you want to save the script.

Download the ZP.sh script:

bash
Copy code
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pro-svg/ZawaProxy/main/ZP.sh
Make the script executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x ZP.sh
Usage
To execute the ZawaProxy script, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
./ZP.sh
This will set up 1.1.1.1 encrypted DNS and create a hotspot named "ZawaProxy" with no password.

Please ensure that your iPhone is jailbroken and that you have the necessary permissions for running scripts.

Important Notes
Use this script responsibly, as modifying system files on a jailbroken device can have consequences.
Always backup your device before making changes.
